# SoftwareSecurity
   In this project I work as a developer for a software engineering company, my clients name was Artemis Financial and they were a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. Our job was to conduct a vulnerability assessment. In it, we had to examine Artemis Financial’s web-based software applicationand use what we learned to review and analyze the security vulnerabilities specific to Artemis Financial’s web-based software application. In this project I found some of the coding to be easier than I thought. 
   Using secure coding standards is a systematic and practical approach to weeding out any common software vulnerabilities from your code. By following standards such as OWASP and SEI CERT, you can make your software more secure for users and avoid legal and financial complications that could result from any exploits, hacks or breaches. Secure coding is important to prevent data theft and to protect the company's reputation of integrity and reliability. When the list of vulnerabilities gets so large, it seems immposible to fix them all. You fix one error and three more pop up.
